  # Confirmed identical relationship between WLP001 and WY1056
  - id: "rel-001"
    type: "identical"
    strains: ["WLP001", "WY1056"]

        source: "White Labs blog post, 2015"
        url: "https://example.com/blog/yeasts"
        notes: "White Labs implied that WLP001 is sourced from the same original strain as Wyeast 1056, but did not state it directly due to trademark concerns."

  # Disputed relationship between WLP001 and US05
  - id: "rel-002"
    type: "similar_but_different"
    strains: ["WLP001", "US05"]
    confidence: "High"
    evidence:
      - type: "Fermentation Profile"
        source: "Brulosophy experiment, 2019"
        url: "https://example.com/experiment"
        notes: "Similar attenuation and flavor profile, but US-05 showed consistently higher flocculation and slightly different ester profile in controlled test."
      
      - type: "Manufacturer Statement"
        source: "Fermentis technical presentation, 2020"
        url: "https://example.com/fermentis/presentation"
        notes: "Fermentis representative indicated that while US-05 is inspired by the Chico strain, it has been selectively bred for dry yeast production and stability."

        source: "Dr. Jane Doe, Yeast Microbiologist"
        citation: "Brewing Science Conference, 2021"
        notes: "While derived from the same original source, the strains have diverged enough through separate propagation methods to be considered distinct variants."
